
This Banking System project, developed in TypeScript, implements classes and interfaces to manage clients and their bank accounts. The system offers functionalities such as:

- **Client Management**: Add, remove, and update client information.
- **Account Creation and Closure**: Support for checking and savings accounts, with income verification and interest application.
- **Banking Operations**: Deposit, withdrawal, account-to-account transfer, and balance checking.

The main classes include `Bank`, `Manager`, `Client`, `AccountCorrentImpl`, and `AccountSavingsImpl`. The code is structured to ensure the integrity of banking operations and compliance with business rules.
